# 0.1.0 (future)

### BREAKING CHANGES

* `Table`, `AbstractTable`, `ClassTableChild`, `ClosureTable`, `EmbeddableTable`, `SingleTableChild` deprecated decorators has been removed.
Use `Entity`, `AbstractEntity`, `ClassEntityChild`, `ClosureEntity`, `EmbeddableEntity`, `SingleEntityChild` decorators instead.
* `EntityManager#create` and `Repository#create`, `EntityManager#preload` and `Repository#preload` methods now accept 
`DeepPartial<Entity>` instead of `Object`
* `EntityManager#merge` and `Repository#merge` methods now accepts `DeepPartial<Entity>` instead of `Object`,
also their first argument is an entity where to need to merge all given entity-like objects.
* changed `find*` repository methods. Now conditions are `Partial<Entity>` which makes them type-safe. 
However now `FindOptions` cannot be used with `findOne`, `findAndCount`, `find` and other methods. 
Use `fineOneByOptions`, `findAndCountByOptions`, `findByOptions` methods instead
* removed `FindOptions` interface and introduced two new interfaces: `FindOneOptions` and `FindManyOptions` - 
each for its own `findOne*` or `find*` methods
* dropped out some of options of `FindOptions`. Use `QueryBuilder` instead.
* deprecated method `addParameters` has been removed from `QueryBuilder`. Use `setParameters` instead.
* table decorators were not removed in the release, however they will be removed in next. Be sure to replace them before that.
* `QueryBuilder#setFirstResult` has been renamed to `QueryBuilder#skip`
* `QueryBuilder#setMaxResults` has been renamed to `QueryBuilder#take`
* renamed `entityManager` to `manager` in `Connection`, `AbstractRepository` and event objects
* renamed `persist` to `save` in `EntityManager` and `Repository` objects
* `@AbstractEntity` is deprecated. Now there is no need to mark class with a decorator, it can extend any class with columns
* `SpecificRepository` is deprecated for now
* `transaction` method has been removed from `Repository`. Use `EntityManager#transaction` method instead
* custom repositories do not support container anymore
* added ActiveRecord support (by extending BaseEntity) class
* controller / subscriber / migrations from options tsconfig now appended with a project root directory
* removed naming strategy decorator, naming strategy by name functionality. 
Now naming strategy should be registered by passing naming strategy instance directly
* `driver` section in connection options now deprecated. All settings should go directly to connection options root.
* removed `fromTable` from the `QueryBuilder`. Now use regular `from` to select from tables
* removed `usePool` option from the connection options
* connection options interface has changed and now each platform has its own set of connection options
* `storage` in sqlite options has been renamed to `database`
* env variable names for connection were changed (`TYPEORM_DRIVER_TYPE` has been renamed to `TYPEORM_CONNECTION`, some other renaming).
More env variable names you can find in `ConnectionOptionsEnvReader` class.
* some api changes in `ConnectionManager` and `createConnection` / `createConnections` methods of typeorm main entrypoint
* `usePool` option has been removed from connection options. Now connections are working only with connection pooling
* `simple_array` column type now is called `simple-array`
* some column types were removed. Now orm uses directly column types of underlying database
* now `number` type in column definitions (like `@Column() likes: number`) maps to `integer` instead of `double` as before.
 This is more programmatic design. If you need to store float-pointing values there define a type explicitly
* `fixedLength` in column options has been removed. Now actual column types can be used, e.g. `@Column("char")` or `@Column("varchar")`
* `timezone` option has been removed from column options. Now corresponding database types can be used instead
* `localTimezone` has been removed from the column options
* `skipSchemaSync` in entity options has been renamed to `skipSync`
* `setLimit` and `setOffset` in `QueryBuilder` were renamed into `limit` and `offset`
* `nativeInterface` has been removed from a driver interface and implementations. 
* now typeorm works with the latest version of mssql (version 4)
* fixed how orm creates default values for SqlServer - now it creates constraints for it as well
* migrations interface has changed - now `up` and `down` accept only `QueryRunner`. To use `Connection` and `EntityManager` use properties
of `QueryRunner`, e.g. `queryRunner.connection` and `queryRunner.manager`
* now `update` method in `QueryBuilder` accepts `Partial<Entity>` and property names used in update map are 
column property names and they are automatically mapped to column names 
* `SpecificRepository` has been removed. Instead new `RelationQueryBuilder` was introduced.
* `getEntitiesAndRawResults` of `QueryBuilder` has been renamed to `getRawAndEntities`
* in mssql all constraints are now generated using table name in their names - this is fixes issues with duplicate constraint names 
* now when object is loaded from the database all its columns with null values will be set into entity properties as null. 
Also after saving entity with unset properties that will be stored as nulls - their (properties) values will be set to null.
Also now all 
* create and update dates in entities now use date with fractional seconds.

### DEPRECATIONS

* `Embedded` decorator is deprecated now. use `@Column(type => SomeEmbedded)` instead

### NEW FEATURES

* added `mongodb` support
* entity now can be saved partially within `update` method
* added prefix support to embeddeds
* now embeddeds inside other embeddeds are supported
* now relations are supported inside embeds
* now relations for multiple primary keys are generated properly
* now ormconfig is read from `.env`, `.js`, `.json`, `.yml`, `.xml` formats
* all database-specific types are supported now
* now migrations generation is supported. Use `typeorm migrations:generate` command
* `getGeneratedQuery` was renamed to `getQuery` in `QueryBuilder`
* `getSqlWithParameters` was renamed to `getSqlAndParameters` in `QueryBuilder`
* sql queries are highlighted in console

### OTHER API CHANGES

* moved `query`, `transaction` and `createQueryBuilder` to the `Connection`. 
`EntityManager` now simply use them from the connection.
* refactored how query runner works, removed query runner provider
* fixed some issues with sqlite, sqlite now strongly works on a single connection 
* `Connection` how has `createQueryRunner` that can be used to control database connection and its transaction state
* `QueryBuilder` is abstract now and all different kinds of query builders were created for different query types - 
`SelectQueryBuilder`, `UpdateQueryBuilder`, `InsertQueryBuilder` and `DeleteQueryBuilder` with individual method available.

### BUG FIXES

* fixes [#285](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/285) - issue when cli commands rise `CannotCloseNotConnectedError`

# 0.0.7

* added custom entity repositories support
* merged typeorm-browser and typeorm libraries into single package
